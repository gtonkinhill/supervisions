he is using the ant book

different from the book:
	idk

upgma & neighbour joining
additivity etc
parsimony

progressive alignment: clustal

sequencing and assembly
euler and hamiltonian paths
This is from the ugly books

Clustering: k-means, soft k-means, markov clustering, t-SNE (novelty! dimensionality reduction)

HMM, BWT
many things are dynamic programming; so check complexities
genscan
TMHMM

if left time at the end; he will do the travelling salesman

questions he'll ask:
- describe complexity of some algortihm
- give me an example
- align these two sequences

my questions:
- when: up to me and the students. In one or two weeks time; a lot of flexibility
- was it 12h last year as well?
